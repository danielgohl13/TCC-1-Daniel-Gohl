@book{white:2011,
abstract = {Eager to develop embedded systems? These systems don't tolerate inefficiency, so you may need a more disciplined approach to programming. This easy-to-read book helps you cultivate a host of good development practices, based on classic software design patterns as well as new patterns unique to embedded programming. You not only learn system architecture, but also specific techniques for dealing with system constraints and manufacturing requirements. Written by an expert who's created embedded systems ranging from urban surveillance and DNA scanners to children's toys, Making Embedded Systems is ideal for intermediate and experienced programmers, no matter what platform you use. Develop an architecture that makes your software robust and maintainable Understand how to make your code smaller, your processor seem faster, and your system use less power Learn how to explore sensors, motors, communications, and other I/O devices Explore tasks that are complicated on embedded systems, such as updating the software and using fixed point math to implement complex algorithms},

abstract = {The connection of physical things to the Internet makes it possible to access remote sensor data and to control the physical world from a distance. The mash-up of captured data with data retrieved from other sources, e.g., with data that is contained in the Web, gives rise to new synergistic services that go beyond the services that can be provided by an isolated embedded system. The Internet of Things is based on this vision. A smart object, which is the building block of the Internet of Things, is just another name for an embedded system that is connected to the Internet. There is another technology that points in the same direction – the RFID technology. The RFID technology, an extension of the ubiquitous optical bar codes that are found on many every-day products, requires the attachment of a smart low-cost electronic ID-tag to a product such that the identity of a product can be decoded from a distance. By putting more intelligence into the ID tag, the tagged thing becomes a smart object. The novelty of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is not in any new disruptive technology, but in the pervasive deployment of smart objects.},

abstract = "Abstract Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as \{RFID\} tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. "
